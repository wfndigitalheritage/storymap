- Google Sheets template https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W9A-3kVfQSdCSgqcwmnowFpi21w4NuaK6327q4gPn1o/edit#gid=0

#### To finalize your map, you need to either:
- Download each Google Sheets tab as a CSV file and upload into a `csv` subfolder in your GitHub repo
  - OR
- Get your own Google Sheets API Key to insert into `google-doc-url.js`
